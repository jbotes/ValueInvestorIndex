Philosophy We are value investors, which means that we invest in companies that we believe trade at a substantial discount to what we consider to be their true business value. We are patient investors, not market timers. We believe that, over time, the price of a stock will rise to reflect the value of the underlying company. Every stock purchase is viewed as if we were buying a piece of a business, not just a stock certificate. We believe that this approach to investing allows for significant investment returns while reducing risk.  Process Because our analysts and portfolio managers seek to identify undervalued companies, the investment process is not based on macro-economic factors, such as the performance of the economy or the direction of interest rates. Nor is it based solely on technical factors, such as the performance of the stock market itself. Instead, we employ an intensive, in-house research process to identify companies that meet our value criteria.  While some value investors may search only for stocks with low price-earnings ratios irrespective of the companies' underlying worth, Oakmark takes a more in-depth approach. In evaluating potential investments, we focus on the following characteristics:  - A company's stock price and whether it is a significant discount to our estimate of underlying business value - Free cash flows & intelligent investment of excess cash - High level of manager ownership",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=oaklx

Strategy  The funds seek to achieve superior long-term performance by acquiring equity securities of financially strong, well-managed companies run by capable managements at market prices significantly below our assessment of their business value. We sell stocks when they approach our appraisal. Equities purchased at prices substantially less than their intrinsic worth protect capital from significant permanent loss and also appreciate substantially once the market recognizes the company's economic value.  A company's market price generally must be 60% or less of our appraisal to qualify for investment. We appraise businesses by studying financial statements, regulatory information, trade publications, and other industry and corporate data, and by talking with corporate managements, competitors and suppliers.  We use two primary methods of appraisal. The first assesses the company's liquidation value based on the current economic worth of assets and liabilities. The second method determines the company's ongoing value based on its ability to generate free cash flow after required capital expenditures and working capital needs. We calculate the present value of the projected free cash flows plus a terminal value, using a conservative discount rate. Our appraisal should represent the price that rational, independent buyers and sellers would negotiate in an arm's length sale. We then check our appraisal against our database of comparable business transactions.  We generally sell a portfolio holding for one of four reasons:  1. The price reaches our appraisal and no margin of safety remains. 2. We can improve our risk/return profile substantially, e.g. we can replace a business selling at 80% of its worth with an equally attractive company at 40% of its value. 3. The future earnings power of the company becomes severely impaired by threats to the business, poor capital allocation, or other reasons. 4. We no longer believe management can build shareholder value and efforts to find new corporate leadership would be unsuccessful or too costly.  The Funds invest under the IRS diversification standard and we generally own 25 or fewer stocks in each portfolio. We hold concentrated portfolios for two main reasons. Concentration lowers our risk of losing capital because we limit the portfolios to our very best ideas, and we know the companies we own and their managements extremely well. Concentration also enables each company to have a meaningful impact on our results when the market recognizes value.  We are long-term owners, not traders or speculators. Our time horizon when purchasing a company is generally three to five years, which our historic portfolio turnover rate reflects. There are no limits on portfolio turnover, however, and we may sell portfolio holdings whenever we believe that sales would benefit shareholders.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=LLPFX

We can improve our risk/return profile substantially, e.g. we can replace a business selling at 80% of its worth with an equally attractive company at 40% of its value. 3. The future earnings power of the company becomes severely impaired by threats to the business, poor capital allocation, or other reasons. 4. We no longer believe management can build shareholder value and efforts to find new corporate leadership would be unsuccessful or too costly.  The Funds invest under the IRS diversification standard and we generally own 25 or fewer stocks in each portfolio. We hold concentrated portfolios for two main reasons. Concentration lowers our risk of losing capital because we limit the portfolios to our very best ideas, and we know the companies we own and their managements extremely well. Concentration also enables each company to have a meaningful impact on our results when the market recognizes value.  We are long-term owners, not traders or speculators.

Strategy  The funds seek to achieve superior long-term performance by acquiring equity securities of financially strong, well-managed companies run by capable managements at market prices significantly below our assessment of their business value. We sell stocks when they approach our appraisal. Equities purchased at prices substantially less than their intrinsic worth protect capital from significant permanent loss and also appreciate substantially once the market recognizes the company's economic value.  A company's market price generally must be 60% or less of our appraisal to qualify for investment. We appraise businesses by studying financial statements, regulatory information, trade publications, and other industry and corporate data, and by talking with corporate managements, competitors and suppliers.  We use two primary methods of appraisal. The first assesses the company's liquidation value based on the current economic worth of assets and liabilities. The second method determines the company's ongoing value based on its ability to generate free cash flow after required capital expenditures and working capital needs. We calculate the present value of the projected free cash flows plus a terminal value, using a conservative discount rate. Our appraisal should represent the price that rational, independent buyers and sellers would negotiate in an arm's length sale.

We then check our appraisal against our database of comparable business transactions.  We generally sell a portfolio holding for one of four reasons:  1. The price reaches our appraisal and no margin of safety remains. 2. We can improve our risk/return profile substantially, e.g. we can replace a business selling at 80% of its worth with an equally attractive company at 40% of its value. 3. The future earnings power of the company becomes severely impaired by threats to the business, poor capital allocation, or other reasons. 4. We no longer believe management can build shareholder value and efforts to find new corporate leadership would be unsuccessful or too costly.  The Funds invest under the IRS diversification standard and we generally own 25 or fewer stocks in each portfolio. We hold concentrated portfolios for two main reasons. Concentration lowers our risk of losing capital because we limit the portfolios to our very best ideas, and we know the companies we own and their managements extremely well. Concentration also enables each company to have a meaningful impact on our results when the market recognizes value.  We are long-term owners, not traders or speculators. Our time horizon when purchasing a company is generally three to five years, which our historic portfolio turnover rate reflects. There are no limits on portfolio turnover, however, and we may sell portfolio holdings whenever we believe that sales would benefit shareholders.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=LLPFX

Strategy  The funds seek to achieve superior long-term performance by acquiring equity securities of financially strong, well-managed companies run by capable managements at market prices significantly below our assessment of their business value. We sell stocks when they approach our appraisal. Equities purchased at prices substantially less than their intrinsic worth protect capital from significant permanent loss and also appreciate substantially once the market recognizes the company's economic value.  A company's market price generally must be 60% or less of our appraisal to qualify for investment. We appraise businesses by studying financial statements, regulatory information, trade publications, and other industry and corporate data, and by talking with corporate managements, competitors and suppliers.  We use two primary methods of appraisal. The first assesses the company's liquidation value based on the current economic worth of assets and liabilities. The second method determines the company's ongoing value based on its ability to generate free cash flow after required capital expenditures and working capital needs. We calculate the present value of the projected free cash flows plus a terminal value, using a conservative discount rate.

Investment Strategy  In seeking to achieve its objective, the Fund invests primarily in common stocks of U.S. companies which Hillman Capital Management, Inc. (the “Advisor”) believes have qualitative and quantitative competitive advantages, as described below, and have temporarily fallen out of favor for reasons that are considered non-recurring or short-term; whose value is not currently well known; or whose value is not fully recognized by the public. As a matter of investment policy, the Fund will invest so that, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its total net assets is invested in publicly traded equity securities of various issuers, including common stock, preferred stock, and securities that may be converted into or are exercisable for common or preferred stock.  In selecting investments for the Fund, the Advisor first looks at qualitative measures of a company. Qualitative measures of a company include:  - dominance in a particular industry or niche market; - management style and adaptability; - strength of pricing and purchasing power; - barriers to industry competition; - strength of brand or franchise with commensurate brand loyalty; and - quality of products and services.  If certain companies meet most or all of the qualitative measures, the Advisor then seeks to identify which of those companies possess certain positive quantitative measures and which of those companies the Advisor feels show superior prospects for growth. The Advisor may make investments without regard to market capitalization. These companies may, in the view of the Advisor, exhibit positive changes such as a promising new product, new distribution strategy, new manufacturing technology, new management team, or new management philosophy. These companies may also be responsible for technological breakthroughs and/or unique solutions to market needs.  The quantitative measures of a company include:  - price-to-book ratio; - present value of discounted projected cash flows; - balance sheet strength; - price-to-sales ratio; - and price-to-earnings ratio.  The Advisor allocates a target percentage of total portfolio value to each security it purchases. Under normal market conditions, the Advisor intends to be fully invested in equities with the portfolio comprised of approximately 20 stocks. From time to time, the Fund may also focus the Fund’s assets in securities of one or more particular sectors of the economy and may at times invest more than 25% of the Fund’s net assets in a particular sector, such as the financial, healthcare, retail, and technology sectors. The Advisor may sell a portfolio holding if the Advisor believes that the price of the security is overvalued or to rebalance the security to the Advisor’s targeted percentage of total portfolio value for that security.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=hcmax

These companies may, in the view of the Advisor, exhibit positive changes such as a promising new product, new distribution strategy, new manufacturing technology, new management team, or new management philosophy. These companies may also be responsible for technological breakthroughs and/or unique solutions to market needs.  The quantitative measures of a company include:  - price-to-book ratio; - present value of discounted projected cash flows; - balance sheet strength; - price-to-sales ratio; - and price-to-earnings ratio.  The Advisor allocates a target percentage of total portfolio value to each security it purchases. Under normal market conditions, the Advisor intends to be fully invested in equities with the portfolio comprised of approximately 20 stocks. From time to time, the Fund may also focus the Fund’s assets in securities of one or more particular sectors of the economy and may at times invest more than 25% of the Fund’s net assets in a particular sector, such as the financial, healthcare, retail, and technology sectors.

Investment Strategy  In seeking to achieve its objective, the Fund invests primarily in common stocks of U.S. companies which Hillman Capital Management, Inc. (the “Advisor”) believes have qualitative and quantitative competitive advantages, as described below, and have temporarily fallen out of favor for reasons that are considered non-recurring or short-term; whose value is not currently well known; or whose value is not fully recognized by the public. As a matter of investment policy, the Fund will invest so that, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its total net assets is invested in publicly traded equity securities of various issuers, including common stock, preferred stock, and securities that may be converted into or are exercisable for common or preferred stock.  In selecting investments for the Fund, the Advisor first looks at qualitative measures of a company. Qualitative measures of a company include:  - dominance in a particular industry or niche market; - management style and adaptability; - strength of pricing and purchasing power; - barriers to industry competition; - strength of brand or franchise with commensurate brand loyalty; and - quality of products and services.  If certain companies meet most or all of the qualitative measures, the Advisor then seeks to identify which of those companies possess certain positive quantitative measures and which of those companies the Advisor feels show superior prospects for growth. The Advisor may make investments without regard to market capitalization.

Investment Strategy  In seeking to achieve its objective, the Fund invests primarily in common stocks of U.S. companies which Hillman Capital Management, Inc. (the “Advisor”) believes have qualitative and quantitative competitive advantages, as described below, and have temporarily fallen out of favor for reasons that are considered non-recurring or short-term; whose value is not currently well known; or whose value is not fully recognized by the public. As a matter of investment policy, the Fund will invest so that, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of its total net assets is invested in publicly traded equity securities of various issuers, including common stock, preferred stock, and securities that may be converted into or are exercisable for common or preferred stock.  In selecting investments for the Fund, the Advisor first looks at qualitative measures of a company. Qualitative measures of a company include:  - dominance in a particular industry or niche market; - management style and adaptability; - strength of pricing and purchasing power; - barriers to industry competition; - strength of brand or franchise with commensurate brand loyalty; and - quality of products and services.  If certain companies meet most or all of the qualitative measures, the Advisor then seeks to identify which of those companies possess certain positive quantitative measures and which of those companies the Advisor feels show superior prospects for growth. The Advisor may make investments without regard to market capitalization. These companies may, in the view of the Advisor, exhibit positive changes such as a promising new product, new distribution strategy, new manufacturing technology, new management team, or new management philosophy. These companies may also be responsible for technological breakthroughs and/or unique solutions to market needs.  The quantitative measures of a company include:  - price-to-book ratio; - present value of discounted projected cash flows; - balance sheet strength; - price-to-sales ratio; - and price-to-earnings ratio.  The Advisor allocates a target percentage of total portfolio value to each security it purchases. Under normal market conditions, the Advisor intends to be fully invested in equities with the portfolio comprised of approximately 20 stocks. From time to time, the Fund may also focus the Fund’s assets in securities of one or more particular sectors of the economy and may at times invest more than 25% of the Fund’s net assets in a particular sector, such as the financial, healthcare, retail, and technology sectors. The Advisor may sell a portfolio holding if the Advisor believes that the price of the security is overvalued or to rebalance the security to the Advisor’s targeted percentage of total portfolio value for that security.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=hcmax

Principal Investment Strategies  The Fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of publicly traded common stocks of U.S. companies. Under normal circumstances, the Fund emphasizes stocks which the Investment Adviser believes are undervalued in relation to an issuer’s long-term earnings power or asset value, or the stock market in general. Securities in which the Fund invests may be undervalued because of many factors, including market decline, poor economic conditions, tax-loss selling or actual or anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the issuer of the security. The Fund may invest in securities of companies with any capitalization across a broad range of industries. The Fund intends to invest at least 65% of its total assets in common stocks and equity-related securities (such as convertible debt securities and warrants). The Fund may invest up to 35% of its total assets in debt or fixed income securities, including higher yield, higher risk, lower rated or unrated corporate bonds commonly referred to as “junk bonds.” These are bonds that are rated Ba or below by Moody’s or BB or below by S&P. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in securities rated Ca or below by Moody’s or C or below by S&P, or unrated but considered by the Investment Adviser to be of comparable quality. The Fund may also invest up to 25% of its total assets, calculated at the time of purchase, in securities of foreign companies, including emerging market companies. If, in the Investment Adviser’s opinion, a stock has reached a fully valued position, it generally will be, but need not be, sold and replaced by securities which are deemed to be undervalued in the marketplace. The Fund generally sells investments when (i) the Investment Adviser concludes that the company’s fundamentals are not meeting expectations; (ii) better investment opportuni- ties exist; and/or (iii) the company’s business has improved and this, in the Investment Adviser’s opinion, is reflected in the share price.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=MVALX

Principal Investment Strategies  The Fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of publicly traded common stocks of U.S. companies. Under normal circumstances, the Fund emphasizes stocks which the Investment Adviser believes are undervalued in relation to an issuer’s long-term earnings power or asset value, or the stock market in general. Securities in which the Fund invests may be undervalued because of many factors, including market decline, poor economic conditions, tax-loss selling or actual or anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the issuer of the security. The Fund may invest in securities of companies with any capitalization across a broad range of industries. The Fund intends to invest at least 65% of its total assets in common stocks and equity-related securities (such as convertible debt securities and warrants). The Fund may invest up to 35% of its total assets in debt or fixed income securities, including higher yield, higher risk, lower rated or unrated corporate bonds commonly referred to as “junk bonds.” These are bonds that are rated Ba or below by Moody’s or BB or below by S&P. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in securities rated Ca or below by Moody’s or C or below by S&P, or unrated but considered by the Investment Adviser to be of comparable quality. The Fund may also invest up to 25% of its total assets, calculated at the time of purchase, in securities of foreign companies, including emerging market companies. If, in the Investment Adviser’s opinion, a stock has reached a fully valued position, it generally will be, but need not be, sold and replaced by securities which are deemed to be undervalued in the marketplace. The Fund generally sells investments when (i) the Investment Adviser concludes that the company’s fundamentals are not meeting expectations; (ii) better investment opportuni- ties exist; and/or (iii) the company’s business has improved and this, in the Investment Adviser’s opinion, is reflected in the share price.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=MVALX

Securities in which the Fund invests may be undervalued because of many factors, including market decline, poor economic conditions, tax-loss selling or actual or anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the issuer of the security. The Fund may invest in securities of companies with any capitalization across a broad range of industries. The Fund intends to invest at least 65% of its total assets in common stocks and equity-related securities (such as convertible debt securities and warrants). The Fund may invest up to 35% of its total assets in debt or fixed income securities, including higher yield, higher risk, lower rated or unrated corporate bonds commonly referred to as “junk bonds.” These are bonds that are rated Ba or below by Moody’s or BB or below by S&P. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in securities rated Ca or below by Moody’s or C or below by S&P, or unrated but considered by the Investment Adviser to be of comparable quality. The Fund may also invest up to 25% of its total assets, calculated at the time of purchase, in securities of foreign companies, including emerging market companies. If, in the Investment Adviser’s opinion, a stock has reached a fully valued position, it generally will be, but need not be, sold and replaced by securities which are deemed to be undervalued in the marketplace. The Fund generally sells investments when (i) the Investment Adviser concludes that the company’s fundamentals are not meeting expectations; (ii) better investment opportuni- ties exist; and/or (iii) the company’s business has improved and this, in the Investment Adviser’s opinion, is reflected in the share price.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=MVALX

Investment Philosophy  The investment management business is unlike most businesses in that the “average” product (in this case, investment returns) is unsatisfactory from the consumers point of view. Managers who even outperform their respective peer groups could well be an unsatisfactory experience as well for the client if returns are less than the market index.  Our respect for index investing and investing as business owners has led us to two aspects of our approach that are quite different than our competitors. To outperform an index, we believe that our portfolios must be constructed as different from an index as possible. Thinking and acting like business owners reduces our interest to those few businesses which are superior. Both of these views lead to our focused (concentrated) approach.  To outperform our peers, we believe that we must emulate the most powerful attributes of index investing. By definition, index investing is “buy and hold” investing. This leads us to our history of minimum turnover of our portfolios. As a corollary, this also affects our stock selection. If we expect to invest in companies for many years, we must then focus on those select companies with the brightest multi-year prospects for growth. In addition, our view on risk is contrary to the typical manager as well. We do not view risk via individual security price volatility (beta), rather all of our risk analysis is centered on the individual business.  Wedgewood’s underlying equity investment philosophy is predicated on a strong belief that significant long-term wealth will be created by investing as “owners” in companies. In our “Invest as Business Owners” approach, we seek companies that the following characteristics:  A dominant product or service that is practically irreplaceable or lacks substitutes. A sustainable and consistent level of growing revenues, earnings and dividends. A high level of profitability, measured by return on equity without the use of excessive debt. A strong management team that is shareholder oriented.  Once we have validated company performance against this set of criteria, we then analyze prospective companies with an eye toward those organizations who have reasonable, if not cheap, valuations.  Process  Successful business owners and executive managers look beyond the next quarter, taking a long-term perspective on maximizing the value in their business and enhancing the sustainability of their business model and market position. This belief is at the core of our “Invest as Owners” process.  Search for past excellence  - Return on equity >25%  - Return on capital >20%  - Cash Flow ROI >15%  - EPS growth >15%  - Revenue growth >12%  Quest for future excellence  - Barriers to entry  - Threat of substitutes  - Buying power  - Supplier power  - Degree of internal rivalry  Portfolio construction  - Priced below intrinsic value  - Projected growth rates  - Conservative valuations multiples  - Risk reduction  The process begins with a focus on up to six hundred of the largest companies as measured by market capitalization. We conduct a detailed quantitative analysis to assess each companies past excellence and to identify those organizations with exceptionally high profitability. Candidate firms are then qualitatively screened to their prospects for future excellence. During this portion of our review, we evaluate a company’s business model by comparing them to Porter’s “Five Forces of Competitive Advantage:”   1. Barriers to entry 2. Threat of substitutes 3. Buying power 4. Supplier power 5.Degree of internal rivalry  Developed by Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School in 1979, this framework draws upon industrial organization economics to determine the competitive intensity and therefore the overall profitability of a market. Once we complete this stage of our review, approximately ten-percent of the companies analyzed meet our criteria as prospective investment candidates. For these sixty or so companies, our Chief Investment Officer and Team of Advisory Managers analyze the candidates to determine which companies are trading at steep discounts relative to their intrinsic value based upon their historical and relative growth rates, conservative consensus estimates and compressed value multiples.  In the end, our “Invest as Owners” process yields eighteen to twenty-four growth companies that we can hold in our client portfolios for the long-term.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=WP

Investment Philosophy  The investment management business is unlike most businesses in that the “average” product (in this case, investment returns) is unsatisfactory from the consumers point of view. Managers who even outperform their respective peer groups could well be an unsatisfactory experience as well for the client if returns are less than the market index.  Our respect for index investing and investing as business owners has led us to two aspects of our approach that are quite different than our competitors. To outperform an index, we believe that our portfolios must be constructed as different from an index as possible. Thinking and acting like business owners reduces our interest to those few businesses which are superior. Both of these views lead to our focused (concentrated) approach.  To outperform our peers, we believe that we must emulate the most powerful attributes of index investing. By definition, index investing is “buy and hold” investing. This leads us to our history of minimum turnover of our portfolios. As a corollary, this also affects our stock selection. If we expect to invest in companies for many years, we must then focus on those select companies with the brightest multi-year prospects for growth. In addition, our view on risk is contrary to the typical manager as well. We do not view risk via individual security price volatility (beta), rather all of our risk analysis is centered on the individual business.  Wedgewood’s underlying equity investment philosophy is predicated on a strong belief that significant long-term wealth will be created by investing as “owners” in companies. In our “Invest as Business Owners” approach, we seek companies that the following characteristics:  A dominant product or service that is practically irreplaceable or lacks substitutes. A sustainable and consistent level of growing revenues, earnings and dividends. A high level of profitability, measured by return on equity without the use of excessive debt. A strong management team that is shareholder oriented.

Investment Philosophy  The investment management business is unlike most businesses in that the “average” product (in this case, investment returns) is unsatisfactory from the consumers point of view. Managers who even outperform their respective peer groups could well be an unsatisfactory experience as well for the client if returns are less than the market index.  Our respect for index investing and investing as business owners has led us to two aspects of our approach that are quite different than our competitors. To outperform an index, we believe that our portfolios must be constructed as different from an index as possible. Thinking and acting like business owners reduces our interest to those few businesses which are superior. Both of these views lead to our focused (concentrated) approach.  To outperform our peers, we believe that we must emulate the most powerful attributes of index investing. By definition, index investing is “buy and hold” investing. This leads us to our history of minimum turnover of our portfolios. As a corollary, this also affects our stock selection. If we expect to invest in companies for many years, we must then focus on those select companies with the brightest multi-year prospects for growth. In addition, our view on risk is contrary to the typical manager as well. We do not view risk via individual security price volatility (beta), rather all of our risk analysis is centered on the individual business.  Wedgewood’s underlying equity investment philosophy is predicated on a strong belief that significant long-term wealth will be created by investing as “owners” in companies. In our “Invest as Business Owners” approach, we seek companies that the following characteristics:  A dominant product or service that is practically irreplaceable or lacks substitutes. A sustainable and consistent level of growing revenues, earnings and dividends. A high level of profitability, measured by return on equity without the use of excessive debt. A strong management team that is shareholder oriented.

Investment Philosophy  The investment management business is unlike most businesses in that the “average” product (in this case, investment returns) is unsatisfactory from the consumers point of view. Managers who even outperform their respective peer groups could well be an unsatisfactory experience as well for the client if returns are less than the market index.  Our respect for index investing and investing as business owners has led us to two aspects of our approach that are quite different than our competitors. To outperform an index, we believe that our portfolios must be constructed as different from an index as possible. Thinking and acting like business owners reduces our interest to those few businesses which are superior. Both of these views lead to our focused (concentrated) approach.  To outperform our peers, we believe that we must emulate the most powerful attributes of index investing. By definition, index investing is “buy and hold” investing. This leads us to our history of minimum turnover of our portfolios. As a corollary, this also affects our stock selection. If we expect to invest in companies for many years, we must then focus on those select companies with the brightest multi-year prospects for growth. In addition, our view on risk is contrary to the typical manager as well. We do not view risk via individual security price volatility (beta), rather all of our risk analysis is centered on the individual business.  Wedgewood’s underlying equity investment philosophy is predicated on a strong belief that significant long-term wealth will be created by investing as “owners” in companies. In our “Invest as Business Owners” approach, we seek companies that the following characteristics:  A dominant product or service that is practically irreplaceable or lacks substitutes. A sustainable and consistent level of growing revenues, earnings and dividends. A high level of profitability, measured by return on equity without the use of excessive debt. A strong management team that is shareholder oriented.

Investment Philosophy  The investment management business is unlike most businesses in that the “average” product (in this case, investment returns) is unsatisfactory from the consumers point of view. Managers who even outperform their respective peer groups could well be an unsatisfactory experience as well for the client if returns are less than the market index.  Our respect for index investing and investing as business owners has led us to two aspects of our approach that are quite different than our competitors. To outperform an index, we believe that our portfolios must be constructed as different from an index as possible. Thinking and acting like business owners reduces our interest to those few businesses which are superior. Both of these views lead to our focused (concentrated) approach.  To outperform our peers, we believe that we must emulate the most powerful attributes of index investing. By definition, index investing is “buy and hold” investing. This leads us to our history of minimum turnover of our portfolios. As a corollary, this also affects our stock selection. If we expect to invest in companies for many years, we must then focus on those select companies with the brightest multi-year prospects for growth. In addition, our view on risk is contrary to the typical manager as well. We do not view risk via individual security price volatility (beta), rather all of our risk analysis is centered on the individual business.  Wedgewood’s underlying equity investment philosophy is predicated on a strong belief that significant long-term wealth will be created by investing as “owners” in companies. In our “Invest as Business Owners” approach, we seek companies that the following characteristics:  A dominant product or service that is practically irreplaceable or lacks substitutes. A sustainable and consistent level of growing revenues, earnings and dividends. A high level of profitability, measured by return on equity without the use of excessive debt. A strong management team that is shareholder oriented.  Once we have validated company performance against this set of criteria, we then analyze prospective companies with an eye toward those organizations who have reasonable, if not cheap, valuations.

Investment Philosophy  The investment management business is unlike most businesses in that the “average” product (in this case, investment returns) is unsatisfactory from the consumers point of view. Managers who even outperform their respective peer groups could well be an unsatisfactory experience as well for the client if returns are less than the market index.  Our respect for index investing and investing as business owners has led us to two aspects of our approach that are quite different than our competitors. To outperform an index, we believe that our portfolios must be constructed as different from an index as possible. Thinking and acting like business owners reduces our interest to those few businesses which are superior. Both of these views lead to our focused (concentrated) approach.  To outperform our peers, we believe that we must emulate the most powerful attributes of index investing. By definition, index investing is “buy and hold” investing. This leads us to our history of minimum turnover of our portfolios. As a corollary, this also affects our stock selection. If we expect to invest in companies for many years, we must then focus on those select companies with the brightest multi-year prospects for growth. In addition, our view on risk is contrary to the typical manager as well. We do not view risk via individual security price volatility (beta), rather all of our risk analysis is centered on the individual business.  Wedgewood’s underlying equity investment philosophy is predicated on a strong belief that significant long-term wealth will be created by investing as “owners” in companies. In our “Invest as Business Owners” approach, we seek companies that the following characteristics:  A dominant product or service that is practically irreplaceable or lacks substitutes. A sustainable and consistent level of growing revenues, earnings and dividends. A high level of profitability, measured by return on equity without the use of excessive debt. A strong management team that is shareholder oriented.  Once we have validated company performance against this set of criteria, we then analyze prospective companies with an eye toward those organizations who have reasonable, if not cheap, valuations.  Process  Successful business owners and executive managers look beyond the next quarter, taking a long-term perspective on maximizing the value in their business and enhancing the sustainability of their business model and market position.

Philosophy  There is a strong correlation between above-average investment performance and error avoidance. To achieve long-term success, an investor must first consider downside risk before considering the potential for appreciation.  A company’s stock price often falls below its private market value due to temporary problems such as missed earnings estimates, over-reaction to short-term results or overall negative market psychology. These short-term deviations may present viable opportunities for the patient, long-term investor.  Excess cash flow is the lifeblood of a business and is the primary determinant of a company's private market value. Companies that generate excess cash flow have the potential to enhance shareholder by increasing dividend payments, repurchasing company shares, reducing outstanding debt, engaging in strategic acquisitions, on withstanding economic downturns without adopting harmful short-term strategies.  Forensic analysis of financial statements reveals the Quality of a company’s Earnings, the success of its strategy, sustainability of its performance and impact of management decisions on future cash flow. Forensic analysis of financial statements is more useful to an investor than management forecasts or earnings guidance.  Emphasizes investments in undervalued equity securities of companies with discernible financial strength, unique business fundamentals, competitive edge and ability to generate free cash flow  Analysis focuses on how a company’s operations generate sustainable free cash flow; how much of that cash is available to investors and the level of ongoing investment required to maintain and grow free cash flow  Valuations based on free cash flow. Reliable valuations require determining if a company’s accounting policies reflect business reality; assessing a company’s Quality of Earnings; accounting adjustments to eliminate management bias, and identifying positive or negative factors that may affect future free cash flow",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=OFALX

Investment Philosophy  What is Value Investing?   ""An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative."" -Benjamin Graham, ""The Intelligent Investor""  The ""value investing"" model, developed by Benjamin Graham in his texts, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, is highly dependent on price. Security selection is therefore a process of identifying situations where companies trade at a significant discount to their liquidation or long-term going-concern value. This discount, defined as the ""margin of safety,"" is critical in two respects. A large margin of safety component not only reduces the risk of a permanent loss of capital but also serves as the platform for significant future gain. Superior returns on investment often result when the marketplace ultimately recognizes the true value of the enterprise.  Value investing incorporates principles that have produced extraordinary returns for money managers through several market cycles over many decades. Kahn Brothers has the experience required to successfully apply these principles to the selection of securities. We do not attempt to time broad directional swings in market levels, interest rates or exchange rates. We are not interested in annual benchmark comparisons. A study of the performance of successful value-oriented investment managers over long periods of time found they under-performed market indices 30% - 40% of the time. In other words, out-performing an index 60% - 70% of the time produced highly satisfactory risk-adjusted rates of returns for these successful managers. Furthermore, investors appreciate that value investing generates tax efficient returns resulting from both long holding periods and favorable tax rates.  Kahn Brothers employs a bottom-up stock selection approach, and invests in undervalued equity securities that are usually out-of-favor in the market. We select securities, one at a time, based on asset valuations, operating performance metrics and long-term fundamental business prospects. Unlike many investment managers, we spend a considerable amount of effort evaluating the downside risk of every investment.  If there are very few values to be found in a given period, we are comfortable holding cash, rather than placing money in speculative, overpriced issues. We will not invest in an overpriced market simply to become fully invested but will patiently wait for attractive situations to present themselves.   Kahn Brothers thinks of a portfolio as an orchard of fruit trees. One cannot expect fruit every year from each species of tree. Investments can and often do have varied and unpredictable timetables to maturity. We believe a suitable time horizon for investment fruit to ripen for harvest can be three to five years or longer. Indeed, a key factor in realizing outstanding performance is having the discipline and patience to maintain time-tested principles and not abandon the orchard before the fruit has ripened.  Kahn Brothers views the investment process as a combination of art and science. Each investment decision has both quantitative and qualitative aspects. While a novice can readily duplicate the former, the latter can only be acquired after decades of analyzing investment opportunities. A key element to outstanding investment performance is bringing these two factors together.  Value investing incorporates only one methodology for securities selection. While many consider it to entail less risk than some other approaches, it can produce returns below popular indices for multiple annual intervals. Value investing may result in concentrated portfolios and will not produce portfolios diversified by investment style. These potential risks must be considered by any investor utilizing the services of Kahn Brothers Advisors LLC.  The following views summarize our methodology for evaluating each specific equity investment:  ""We study companies and try to find undervalued securities... We're absolute value investors focusing on asset values, book value discounts and low price to earnings ratios to normalized earnings. And we aren't interested in so-called relative values -- you know, something selling at 20 times earnings in an industry group with a 35 multiple."" -Thomas Graham Kahn, ""Outstanding Investor Digest""  I. Broad Investment Criteria  INDUSTRY - We invest in industries and businesses that we understand, focusing on depressed economic sectors, rather than the popular industries of the day. Significant capital gains can be achieved through investment in well-established industries. We therefore prefer seasoned businesses less likely to experience major structural change.  COMPANY SIZE - We often concentrate on small and medium capitalization stocks. Such securities may be traded in the less liquid over-the counter market. These companies frequently have a lesser following among security analysts and institutional investors. Small institutional ownership increases the likelihood of inefficient pricing, which helps create bargain opportunities.  MANAGEMENT - We prefer a company whose management holds a meaningful stake in the growth of the business and will protect their own, as well as the shareholders interests. We are less comfortable with situations in which management has aggressive compensation packages, little financial risk and nominal ownership interest.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE - We search for companies with solid balance sheets, strong working capital positions and minimal leverage. We analyze the balance sheet, not the income statement, first. Consequently, many of our investments have strong financial positions and weak short-term earnings. Companies with depressed earnings are more likely to be under-priced in the market.  II. Typical Investment Metrics  NET WORKING CAPITAL DISCOUNTS are stocks selling below net working capital per share after subtracting all long-term liabilities. In other words, if you subtract all current liabilities from all current assets, then further subtract all long-term liabilities and, finally, divide the remaining figure by the number of shares outstanding, you derive the net working capital per share. If a stock sells for less than this figure, you have an attractive price that always warrants a thorough investigation.  BOOK VALUE DISCOUNTS are securities that sell for less than the adjusted per share book value (stated net worth) on their balance sheet. Book value per share is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets and then dividing the remaining balance by the number of outstanding shares. Intangible assets are typically excluded from our definition of book value, and assets and liabilities often require some fair market value adjustments.  LOW P/E RATIO STOCKS are securities that sell at low price to normalized earnings multiples or price to normalized cash flow. They may sell at high multiples of current earnings or cash flow.  SPECIAL SITUATIONS include companies potentially impacted by catalysts that are likely to trigger the unlocking of value that will result in significant capital gains.  FALLEN ANGELS are quality companies with strong market and financial positions that suffer from short-term but resolvable issues, while still possessing the capacity for materially improved long-term earnings. These are rarely book value discounts.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=KB

Significant capital gains can be achieved through investment in well-established industries. We therefore prefer seasoned businesses less likely to experience major structural change.  COMPANY SIZE - We often concentrate on small and medium capitalization stocks. Such securities may be traded in the less liquid over-the counter market. These companies frequently have a lesser following among security analysts and institutional investors. Small institutional ownership increases the likelihood of inefficient pricing, which helps create bargain opportunities.  MANAGEMENT - We prefer a company whose management holds a meaningful stake in the growth of the business and will protect their own, as well as the shareholders interests. We are less comfortable with situations in which management has aggressive compensation packages, little financial risk and nominal ownership interest.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE - We search for companies with solid balance sheets, strong working capital positions and minimal leverage. We analyze the balance sheet, not the income statement, first. Consequently, many of our investments have strong financial positions and weak short-term earnings. Companies with depressed earnings are more likely to be under-priced in the market.  II. Typical Investment Metrics  NET WORKING CAPITAL DISCOUNTS are stocks selling below net working capital per share after subtracting all long-term liabilities. In other words, if you subtract all current liabilities from all current assets, then further subtract all long-term liabilities and, finally, divide the remaining figure by the number of shares outstanding, you derive the net working capital per share. If a stock sells for less than this figure, you have an attractive price that always warrants a thorough investigation.  BOOK VALUE DISCOUNTS are securities that sell for less than the adjusted per share book value (stated net worth) on their balance sheet. Book value per share is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets and then dividing the remaining balance by the number of outstanding shares. Intangible assets are typically excluded from our definition of book value, and assets and liabilities often require some fair market value adjustments.  LOW P/E RATIO STOCKS are securities that sell at low price to normalized earnings multiples or price to normalized cash flow. They may sell at high multiples of current earnings or cash flow.  SPECIAL SITUATIONS include companies potentially impacted by catalysts that are likely to trigger the unlocking of value that will result in significant capital gains.  FALLEN ANGELS are quality companies with strong market and financial positions that suffer from short-term but resolvable issues, while still possessing the capacity for materially improved long-term earnings. These are rarely book value discounts.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=KB

Investment Philosophy  What is Value Investing?   ""An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative."" -Benjamin Graham, ""The Intelligent Investor""  The ""value investing"" model, developed by Benjamin Graham in his texts, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, is highly dependent on price. Security selection is therefore a process of identifying situations where companies trade at a significant discount to their liquidation or long-term going-concern value. This discount, defined as the ""margin of safety,"" is critical in two respects. A large margin of safety component not only reduces the risk of a permanent loss of capital but also serves as the platform for significant future gain. Superior returns on investment often result when the marketplace ultimately recognizes the true value of the enterprise.  Value investing incorporates principles that have produced extraordinary returns for money managers through several market cycles over many decades. Kahn Brothers has the experience required to successfully apply these principles to the selection of securities. We do not attempt to time broad directional swings in market levels, interest rates or exchange rates. We are not interested in annual benchmark comparisons. A study of the performance of successful value-oriented investment managers over long periods of time found they under-performed market indices 30% - 40% of the time. In other words, out-performing an index 60% - 70% of the time produced highly satisfactory risk-adjusted rates of returns for these successful managers. Furthermore, investors appreciate that value investing generates tax efficient returns resulting from both long holding periods and favorable tax rates.  Kahn Brothers employs a bottom-up stock selection approach, and invests in undervalued equity securities that are usually out-of-favor in the market. We select securities, one at a time, based on asset valuations, operating performance metrics and long-term fundamental business prospects. Unlike many investment managers, we spend a considerable amount of effort evaluating the downside risk of every investment.  If there are very few values to be found in a given period, we are comfortable holding cash, rather than placing money in speculative, overpriced issues. We will not invest in an overpriced market simply to become fully invested but will patiently wait for attractive situations to present themselves.   Kahn Brothers thinks of a portfolio as an orchard of fruit trees. One cannot expect fruit every year from each species of tree. Investments can and often do have varied and unpredictable timetables to maturity. We believe a suitable time horizon for investment fruit to ripen for harvest can be three to five years or longer. Indeed, a key factor in realizing outstanding performance is having the discipline and patience to maintain time-tested principles and not abandon the orchard before the fruit has ripened.  Kahn Brothers views the investment process as a combination of art and science. Each investment decision has both quantitative and qualitative aspects. While a novice can readily duplicate the former, the latter can only be acquired after decades of analyzing investment opportunities. A key element to outstanding investment performance is bringing these two factors together.  Value investing incorporates only one methodology for securities selection. While many consider it to entail less risk than some other approaches, it can produce returns below popular indices for multiple annual intervals. Value investing may result in concentrated portfolios and will not produce portfolios diversified by investment style. These potential risks must be considered by any investor utilizing the services of Kahn Brothers Advisors LLC.  The following views summarize our methodology for evaluating each specific equity investment:  ""We study companies and try to find undervalued securities... We're absolute value investors focusing on asset values, book value discounts and low price to earnings ratios to normalized earnings.

Investment Philosophy  What is Value Investing?   ""An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative."" -Benjamin Graham, ""The Intelligent Investor""  The ""value investing"" model, developed by Benjamin Graham in his texts, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, is highly dependent on price. Security selection is therefore a process of identifying situations where companies trade at a significant discount to their liquidation or long-term going-concern value. This discount, defined as the ""margin of safety,"" is critical in two respects. A large margin of safety component not only reduces the risk of a permanent loss of capital but also serves as the platform for significant future gain. Superior returns on investment often result when the marketplace ultimately recognizes the true value of the enterprise.  Value investing incorporates principles that have produced extraordinary returns for money managers through several market cycles over many decades. Kahn Brothers has the experience required to successfully apply these principles to the selection of securities. We do not attempt to time broad directional swings in market levels, interest rates or exchange rates. We are not interested in annual benchmark comparisons. A study of the performance of successful value-oriented investment managers over long periods of time found they under-performed market indices 30% - 40% of the time. In other words, out-performing an index 60% - 70% of the time produced highly satisfactory risk-adjusted rates of returns for these successful managers. Furthermore, investors appreciate that value investing generates tax efficient returns resulting from both long holding periods and favorable tax rates.  Kahn Brothers employs a bottom-up stock selection approach, and invests in undervalued equity securities that are usually out-of-favor in the market. We select securities, one at a time, based on asset valuations, operating performance metrics and long-term fundamental business prospects. Unlike many investment managers, we spend a considerable amount of effort evaluating the downside risk of every investment.  If there are very few values to be found in a given period, we are comfortable holding cash, rather than placing money in speculative, overpriced issues. We will not invest in an overpriced market simply to become fully invested but will patiently wait for attractive situations to present themselves.   Kahn Brothers thinks of a portfolio as an orchard of fruit trees. One cannot expect fruit every year from each species of tree. Investments can and often do have varied and unpredictable timetables to maturity. We believe a suitable time horizon for investment fruit to ripen for harvest can be three to five years or longer. Indeed, a key factor in realizing outstanding performance is having the discipline and patience to maintain time-tested principles and not abandon the orchard before the fruit has ripened.  Kahn Brothers views the investment process as a combination of art and science. Each investment decision has both quantitative and qualitative aspects. While a novice can readily duplicate the former, the latter can only be acquired after decades of analyzing investment opportunities. A key element to outstanding investment performance is bringing these two factors together.  Value investing incorporates only one methodology for securities selection. While many consider it to entail less risk than some other approaches, it can produce returns below popular indices for multiple annual intervals. Value investing may result in concentrated portfolios and will not produce portfolios diversified by investment style. These potential risks must be considered by any investor utilizing the services of Kahn Brothers Advisors LLC.  The following views summarize our methodology for evaluating each specific equity investment:  ""We study companies and try to find undervalued securities... We're absolute value investors focusing on asset values, book value discounts and low price to earnings ratios to normalized earnings. And we aren't interested in so-called relative values -- you know, something selling at 20 times earnings in an industry group with a 35 multiple."" -Thomas Graham Kahn, ""Outstanding Investor Digest""  I. Broad Investment Criteria  INDUSTRY - We invest in industries and businesses that we understand, focusing on depressed economic sectors, rather than the popular industries of the day. Significant capital gains can be achieved through investment in well-established industries. We therefore prefer seasoned businesses less likely to experience major structural change.  COMPANY SIZE - We often concentrate on small and medium capitalization stocks. Such securities may be traded in the less liquid over-the counter market. These companies frequently have a lesser following among security analysts and institutional investors. Small institutional ownership increases the likelihood of inefficient pricing, which helps create bargain opportunities.  MANAGEMENT - We prefer a company whose management holds a meaningful stake in the growth of the business and will protect their own, as well as the shareholders interests. We are less comfortable with situations in which management has aggressive compensation packages, little financial risk and nominal ownership interest.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE - We search for companies with solid balance sheets, strong working capital positions and minimal leverage. We analyze the balance sheet, not the income statement, first. Consequently, many of our investments have strong financial positions and weak short-term earnings. Companies with depressed earnings are more likely to be under-priced in the market.  II. Typical Investment Metrics  NET WORKING CAPITAL DISCOUNTS are stocks selling below net working capital per share after subtracting all long-term liabilities. In other words, if you subtract all current liabilities from all current assets, then further subtract all long-term liabilities and, finally, divide the remaining figure by the number of shares outstanding, you derive the net working capital per share. If a stock sells for less than this figure, you have an attractive price that always warrants a thorough investigation.  BOOK VALUE DISCOUNTS are securities that sell for less than the adjusted per share book value (stated net worth) on their balance sheet. Book value per share is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets and then dividing the remaining balance by the number of outstanding shares. Intangible assets are typically excluded from our definition of book value, and assets and liabilities often require some fair market value adjustments.

And we aren't interested in so-called relative values -- you know, something selling at 20 times earnings in an industry group with a 35 multiple."" -Thomas Graham Kahn, ""Outstanding Investor Digest""  I. Broad Investment Criteria  INDUSTRY - We invest in industries and businesses that we understand, focusing on depressed economic sectors, rather than the popular industries of the day. Significant capital gains can be achieved through investment in well-established industries. We therefore prefer seasoned businesses less likely to experience major structural change.  COMPANY SIZE - We often concentrate on small and medium capitalization stocks. Such securities may be traded in the less liquid over-the counter market. These companies frequently have a lesser following among security analysts and institutional investors. Small institutional ownership increases the likelihood of inefficient pricing, which helps create bargain opportunities.  MANAGEMENT - We prefer a company whose management holds a meaningful stake in the growth of the business and will protect their own, as well as the shareholders interests. We are less comfortable with situations in which management has aggressive compensation packages, little financial risk and nominal ownership interest.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE - We search for companies with solid balance sheets, strong working capital positions and minimal leverage. We analyze the balance sheet, not the income statement, first. Consequently, many of our investments have strong financial positions and weak short-term earnings. Companies with depressed earnings are more likely to be under-priced in the market.  II. Typical Investment Metrics  NET WORKING CAPITAL DISCOUNTS are stocks selling below net working capital per share after subtracting all long-term liabilities. In other words, if you subtract all current liabilities from all current assets, then further subtract all long-term liabilities and, finally, divide the remaining figure by the number of shares outstanding, you derive the net working capital per share. If a stock sells for less than this figure, you have an attractive price that always warrants a thorough investigation.  BOOK VALUE DISCOUNTS are securities that sell for less than the adjusted per share book value (stated net worth) on their balance sheet. Book value per share is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets and then dividing the remaining balance by the number of outstanding shares. Intangible assets are typically excluded from our definition of book value, and assets and liabilities often require some fair market value adjustments.  LOW P/E RATIO STOCKS are securities that sell at low price to normalized earnings multiples or price to normalized cash flow. They may sell at high multiples of current earnings or cash flow.  SPECIAL SITUATIONS include companies potentially impacted by catalysts that are likely to trigger the unlocking of value that will result in significant capital gains.  FALLEN ANGELS are quality companies with strong market and financial positions that suffer from short-term but resolvable issues, while still possessing the capacity for materially improved long-term earnings. These are rarely book value discounts.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=KB

Investment Philosophy  What is Value Investing?   ""An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative."" -Benjamin Graham, ""The Intelligent Investor""  The ""value investing"" model, developed by Benjamin Graham in his texts, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, is highly dependent on price. Security selection is therefore a process of identifying situations where companies trade at a significant discount to their liquidation or long-term going-concern value. This discount, defined as the ""margin of safety,"" is critical in two respects. A large margin of safety component not only reduces the risk of a permanent loss of capital but also serves as the platform for significant future gain. Superior returns on investment often result when the marketplace ultimately recognizes the true value of the enterprise.

And we aren't interested in so-called relative values -- you know, something selling at 20 times earnings in an industry group with a 35 multiple."" -Thomas Graham Kahn, ""Outstanding Investor Digest""  I. Broad Investment Criteria  INDUSTRY - We invest in industries and businesses that we understand, focusing on depressed economic sectors, rather than the popular industries of the day. Significant capital gains can be achieved through investment in well-established industries. We therefore prefer seasoned businesses less likely to experience major structural change.  COMPANY SIZE - We often concentrate on small and medium capitalization stocks. Such securities may be traded in the less liquid over-the counter market. These companies frequently have a lesser following among security analysts and institutional investors. Small institutional ownership increases the likelihood of inefficient pricing, which helps create bargain opportunities.  MANAGEMENT - We prefer a company whose management holds a meaningful stake in the growth of the business and will protect their own, as well as the shareholders interests. We are less comfortable with situations in which management has aggressive compensation packages, little financial risk and nominal ownership interest.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE - We search for companies with solid balance sheets, strong working capital positions and minimal leverage. We analyze the balance sheet, not the income statement, first. Consequently, many of our investments have strong financial positions and weak short-term earnings. Companies with depressed earnings are more likely to be under-priced in the market.  II. Typical Investment Metrics  NET WORKING CAPITAL DISCOUNTS are stocks selling below net working capital per share after subtracting all long-term liabilities. In other words, if you subtract all current liabilities from all current assets, then further subtract all long-term liabilities and, finally, divide the remaining figure by the number of shares outstanding, you derive the net working capital per share. If a stock sells for less than this figure, you have an attractive price that always warrants a thorough investigation.  BOOK VALUE DISCOUNTS are securities that sell for less than the adjusted per share book value (stated net worth) on their balance sheet. Book value per share is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets and then dividing the remaining balance by the number of outstanding shares. Intangible assets are typically excluded from our definition of book value, and assets and liabilities often require some fair market value adjustments.  LOW P/E RATIO STOCKS are securities that sell at low price to normalized earnings multiples or price to normalized cash flow. They may sell at high multiples of current earnings or cash flow.  SPECIAL SITUATIONS include companies potentially impacted by catalysts that are likely to trigger the unlocking of value that will result in significant capital gains.  FALLEN ANGELS are quality companies with strong market and financial positions that suffer from short-term but resolvable issues, while still possessing the capacity for materially improved long-term earnings. These are rarely book value discounts.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=KB

Investment Philosophy  What is Value Investing?   ""An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative."" -Benjamin Graham, ""The Intelligent Investor""  The ""value investing"" model, developed by Benjamin Graham in his texts, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, is highly dependent on price. Security selection is therefore a process of identifying situations where companies trade at a significant discount to their liquidation or long-term going-concern value. This discount, defined as the ""margin of safety,"" is critical in two respects. A large margin of safety component not only reduces the risk of a permanent loss of capital but also serves as the platform for significant future gain. Superior returns on investment often result when the marketplace ultimately recognizes the true value of the enterprise.  Value investing incorporates principles that have produced extraordinary returns for money managers through several market cycles over many decades. Kahn Brothers has the experience required to successfully apply these principles to the selection of securities. We do not attempt to time broad directional swings in market levels, interest rates or exchange rates. We are not interested in annual benchmark comparisons. A study of the performance of successful value-oriented investment managers over long periods of time found they under-performed market indices 30% - 40% of the time. In other words, out-performing an index 60% - 70% of the time produced highly satisfactory risk-adjusted rates of returns for these successful managers. Furthermore, investors appreciate that value investing generates tax efficient returns resulting from both long holding periods and favorable tax rates.  Kahn Brothers employs a bottom-up stock selection approach, and invests in undervalued equity securities that are usually out-of-favor in the market. We select securities, one at a time, based on asset valuations, operating performance metrics and long-term fundamental business prospects. Unlike many investment managers, we spend a considerable amount of effort evaluating the downside risk of every investment.  If there are very few values to be found in a given period, we are comfortable holding cash, rather than placing money in speculative, overpriced issues. We will not invest in an overpriced market simply to become fully invested but will patiently wait for attractive situations to present themselves.   Kahn Brothers thinks of a portfolio as an orchard of fruit trees. One cannot expect fruit every year from each species of tree. Investments can and often do have varied and unpredictable timetables to maturity. We believe a suitable time horizon for investment fruit to ripen for harvest can be three to five years or longer. Indeed, a key factor in realizing outstanding performance is having the discipline and patience to maintain time-tested principles and not abandon the orchard before the fruit has ripened.  Kahn Brothers views the investment process as a combination of art and science. Each investment decision has both quantitative and qualitative aspects. While a novice can readily duplicate the former, the latter can only be acquired after decades of analyzing investment opportunities. A key element to outstanding investment performance is bringing these two factors together.  Value investing incorporates only one methodology for securities selection. While many consider it to entail less risk than some other approaches, it can produce returns below popular indices for multiple annual intervals. Value investing may result in concentrated portfolios and will not produce portfolios diversified by investment style. These potential risks must be considered by any investor utilizing the services of Kahn Brothers Advisors LLC.

Investment Philosophy  What is Value Investing?   ""An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative."" -Benjamin Graham, ""The Intelligent Investor""  The ""value investing"" model, developed by Benjamin Graham in his texts, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, is highly dependent on price. Security selection is therefore a process of identifying situations where companies trade at a significant discount to their liquidation or long-term going-concern value. This discount, defined as the ""margin of safety,"" is critical in two respects. A large margin of safety component not only reduces the risk of a permanent loss of capital but also serves as the platform for significant future gain. Superior returns on investment often result when the marketplace ultimately recognizes the true value of the enterprise.  Value investing incorporates principles that have produced extraordinary returns for money managers through several market cycles over many decades. Kahn Brothers has the experience required to successfully apply these principles to the selection of securities. We do not attempt to time broad directional swings in market levels, interest rates or exchange rates. We are not interested in annual benchmark comparisons. A study of the performance of successful value-oriented investment managers over long periods of time found they under-performed market indices 30% - 40% of the time. In other words, out-performing an index 60% - 70% of the time produced highly satisfactory risk-adjusted rates of returns for these successful managers. Furthermore, investors appreciate that value investing generates tax efficient returns resulting from both long holding periods and favorable tax rates.  Kahn Brothers employs a bottom-up stock selection approach, and invests in undervalued equity securities that are usually out-of-favor in the market. We select securities, one at a time, based on asset valuations, operating performance metrics and long-term fundamental business prospects. Unlike many investment managers, we spend a considerable amount of effort evaluating the downside risk of every investment.  If there are very few values to be found in a given period, we are comfortable holding cash, rather than placing money in speculative, overpriced issues. We will not invest in an overpriced market simply to become fully invested but will patiently wait for attractive situations to present themselves.   Kahn Brothers thinks of a portfolio as an orchard of fruit trees. One cannot expect fruit every year from each species of tree. Investments can and often do have varied and unpredictable timetables to maturity. We believe a suitable time horizon for investment fruit to ripen for harvest can be three to five years or longer. Indeed, a key factor in realizing outstanding performance is having the discipline and patience to maintain time-tested principles and not abandon the orchard before the fruit has ripened.  Kahn Brothers views the investment process as a combination of art and science. Each investment decision has both quantitative and qualitative aspects. While a novice can readily duplicate the former, the latter can only be acquired after decades of analyzing investment opportunities. A key element to outstanding investment performance is bringing these two factors together.  Value investing incorporates only one methodology for securities selection. While many consider it to entail less risk than some other approaches, it can produce returns below popular indices for multiple annual intervals. Value investing may result in concentrated portfolios and will not produce portfolios diversified by investment style. These potential risks must be considered by any investor utilizing the services of Kahn Brothers Advisors LLC.  The following views summarize our methodology for evaluating each specific equity investment:  ""We study companies and try to find undervalued securities... We're absolute value investors focusing on asset values, book value discounts and low price to earnings ratios to normalized earnings. And we aren't interested in so-called relative values -- you know, something selling at 20 times earnings in an industry group with a 35 multiple."" -Thomas Graham Kahn, ""Outstanding Investor Digest""  I. Broad Investment Criteria  INDUSTRY - We invest in industries and businesses that we understand, focusing on depressed economic sectors, rather than the popular industries of the day. Significant capital gains can be achieved through investment in well-established industries. We therefore prefer seasoned businesses less likely to experience major structural change.  COMPANY SIZE - We often concentrate on small and medium capitalization stocks. Such securities may be traded in the less liquid over-the counter market. These companies frequently have a lesser following among security analysts and institutional investors. Small institutional ownership increases the likelihood of inefficient pricing, which helps create bargain opportunities.  MANAGEMENT - We prefer a company whose management holds a meaningful stake in the growth of the business and will protect their own, as well as the shareholders interests. We are less comfortable with situations in which management has aggressive compensation packages, little financial risk and nominal ownership interest.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE - We search for companies with solid balance sheets, strong working capital positions and minimal leverage. We analyze the balance sheet, not the income statement, first. Consequently, many of our investments have strong financial positions and weak short-term earnings. Companies with depressed earnings are more likely to be under-priced in the market.  II. Typical Investment Metrics  NET WORKING CAPITAL DISCOUNTS are stocks selling below net working capital per share after subtracting all long-term liabilities. In other words, if you subtract all current liabilities from all current assets, then further subtract all long-term liabilities and, finally, divide the remaining figure by the number of shares outstanding, you derive the net working capital per share. If a stock sells for less than this figure, you have an attractive price that always warrants a thorough investigation.  BOOK VALUE DISCOUNTS are securities that sell for less than the adjusted per share book value (stated net worth) on their balance sheet. Book value per share is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets and then dividing the remaining balance by the number of outstanding shares. Intangible assets are typically excluded from our definition of book value, and assets and liabilities often require some fair market value adjustments.

And we aren't interested in so-called relative values -- you know, something selling at 20 times earnings in an industry group with a 35 multiple."" -Thomas Graham Kahn, ""Outstanding Investor Digest""  I. Broad Investment Criteria  INDUSTRY - We invest in industries and businesses that we understand, focusing on depressed economic sectors, rather than the popular industries of the day. Significant capital gains can be achieved through investment in well-established industries. We therefore prefer seasoned businesses less likely to experience major structural change.  COMPANY SIZE - We often concentrate on small and medium capitalization stocks. Such securities may be traded in the less liquid over-the counter market. These companies frequently have a lesser following among security analysts and institutional investors. Small institutional ownership increases the likelihood of inefficient pricing, which helps create bargain opportunities.  MANAGEMENT - We prefer a company whose management holds a meaningful stake in the growth of the business and will protect their own, as well as the shareholders interests. We are less comfortable with situations in which management has aggressive compensation packages, little financial risk and nominal ownership interest.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE - We search for companies with solid balance sheets, strong working capital positions and minimal leverage. We analyze the balance sheet, not the income statement, first. Consequently, many of our investments have strong financial positions and weak short-term earnings. Companies with depressed earnings are more likely to be under-priced in the market.  II. Typical Investment Metrics  NET WORKING CAPITAL DISCOUNTS are stocks selling below net working capital per share after subtracting all long-term liabilities. In other words, if you subtract all current liabilities from all current assets, then further subtract all long-term liabilities and, finally, divide the remaining figure by the number of shares outstanding, you derive the net working capital per share. If a stock sells for less than this figure, you have an attractive price that always warrants a thorough investigation.  BOOK VALUE DISCOUNTS are securities that sell for less than the adjusted per share book value (stated net worth) on their balance sheet. Book value per share is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets and then dividing the remaining balance by the number of outstanding shares. Intangible assets are typically excluded from our definition of book value, and assets and liabilities often require some fair market value adjustments.  LOW P/E RATIO STOCKS are securities that sell at low price to normalized earnings multiples or price to normalized cash flow. They may sell at high multiples of current earnings or cash flow.  SPECIAL SITUATIONS include companies potentially impacted by catalysts that are likely to trigger the unlocking of value that will result in significant capital gains.  FALLEN ANGELS are quality companies with strong market and financial positions that suffer from short-term but resolvable issues, while still possessing the capacity for materially improved long-term earnings. These are rarely book value discounts.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=KB

Investment Philosophy  What is Value Investing?   ""An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative."" -Benjamin Graham, ""The Intelligent Investor""  The ""value investing"" model, developed by Benjamin Graham in his texts, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, is highly dependent on price. Security selection is therefore a process of identifying situations where companies trade at a significant discount to their liquidation or long-term going-concern value. This discount, defined as the ""margin of safety,"" is critical in two respects. A large margin of safety component not only reduces the risk of a permanent loss of capital but also serves as the platform for significant future gain. Superior returns on investment often result when the marketplace ultimately recognizes the true value of the enterprise.  Value investing incorporates principles that have produced extraordinary returns for money managers through several market cycles over many decades.

And we aren't interested in so-called relative values -- you know, something selling at 20 times earnings in an industry group with a 35 multiple."" -Thomas Graham Kahn, ""Outstanding Investor Digest""  I. Broad Investment Criteria  INDUSTRY - We invest in industries and businesses that we understand, focusing on depressed economic sectors, rather than the popular industries of the day. Significant capital gains can be achieved through investment in well-established industries. We therefore prefer seasoned businesses less likely to experience major structural change.  COMPANY SIZE - We often concentrate on small and medium capitalization stocks. Such securities may be traded in the less liquid over-the counter market. These companies frequently have a lesser following among security analysts and institutional investors. Small institutional ownership increases the likelihood of inefficient pricing, which helps create bargain opportunities.  MANAGEMENT - We prefer a company whose management holds a meaningful stake in the growth of the business and will protect their own, as well as the shareholders interests. We are less comfortable with situations in which management has aggressive compensation packages, little financial risk and nominal ownership interest.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE - We search for companies with solid balance sheets, strong working capital positions and minimal leverage. We analyze the balance sheet, not the income statement, first. Consequently, many of our investments have strong financial positions and weak short-term earnings. Companies with depressed earnings are more likely to be under-priced in the market.  II. Typical Investment Metrics  NET WORKING CAPITAL DISCOUNTS are stocks selling below net working capital per share after subtracting all long-term liabilities. In other words, if you subtract all current liabilities from all current assets, then further subtract all long-term liabilities and, finally, divide the remaining figure by the number of shares outstanding, you derive the net working capital per share. If a stock sells for less than this figure, you have an attractive price that always warrants a thorough investigation.  BOOK VALUE DISCOUNTS are securities that sell for less than the adjusted per share book value (stated net worth) on their balance sheet. Book value per share is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets and then dividing the remaining balance by the number of outstanding shares. Intangible assets are typically excluded from our definition of book value, and assets and liabilities often require some fair market value adjustments.  LOW P/E RATIO STOCKS are securities that sell at low price to normalized earnings multiples or price to normalized cash flow. They may sell at high multiples of current earnings or cash flow.  SPECIAL SITUATIONS include companies potentially impacted by catalysts that are likely to trigger the unlocking of value that will result in significant capital gains.  FALLEN ANGELS are quality companies with strong market and financial positions that suffer from short-term but resolvable issues, while still possessing the capacity for materially improved long-term earnings. These are rarely book value discounts.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=KB

Investment Philosophy  What is Value Investing?   ""An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative."" -Benjamin Graham, ""The Intelligent Investor""  The ""value investing"" model, developed by Benjamin Graham in his texts, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, is highly dependent on price. Security selection is therefore a process of identifying situations where companies trade at a significant discount to their liquidation or long-term going-concern value. This discount, defined as the ""margin of safety,"" is critical in two respects. A large margin of safety component not only reduces the risk of a permanent loss of capital but also serves as the platform for significant future gain. Superior returns on investment often result when the marketplace ultimately recognizes the true value of the enterprise.  Value investing incorporates principles that have produced extraordinary returns for money managers through several market cycles over many decades. Kahn Brothers has the experience required to successfully apply these principles to the selection of securities. We do not attempt to time broad directional swings in market levels, interest rates or exchange rates. We are not interested in annual benchmark comparisons. A study of the performance of successful value-oriented investment managers over long periods of time found they under-performed market indices 30% - 40% of the time. In other words, out-performing an index 60% - 70% of the time produced highly satisfactory risk-adjusted rates of returns for these successful managers. Furthermore, investors appreciate that value investing generates tax efficient returns resulting from both long holding periods and favorable tax rates.  Kahn Brothers employs a bottom-up stock selection approach, and invests in undervalued equity securities that are usually out-of-favor in the market. We select securities, one at a time, based on asset valuations, operating performance metrics and long-term fundamental business prospects. Unlike many investment managers, we spend a considerable amount of effort evaluating the downside risk of every investment.  If there are very few values to be found in a given period, we are comfortable holding cash, rather than placing money in speculative, overpriced issues. We will not invest in an overpriced market simply to become fully invested but will patiently wait for attractive situations to present themselves.   Kahn Brothers thinks of a portfolio as an orchard of fruit trees. One cannot expect fruit every year from each species of tree. Investments can and often do have varied and unpredictable timetables to maturity. We believe a suitable time horizon for investment fruit to ripen for harvest can be three to five years or longer. Indeed, a key factor in realizing outstanding performance is having the discipline and patience to maintain time-tested principles and not abandon the orchard before the fruit has ripened.  Kahn Brothers views the investment process as a combination of art and science. Each investment decision has both quantitative and qualitative aspects. While a novice can readily duplicate the former, the latter can only be acquired after decades of analyzing investment opportunities. A key element to outstanding investment performance is bringing these two factors together.  Value investing incorporates only one methodology for securities selection. While many consider it to entail less risk than some other approaches, it can produce returns below popular indices for multiple annual intervals. Value investing may result in concentrated portfolios and will not produce portfolios diversified by investment style. These potential risks must be considered by any investor utilizing the services of Kahn Brothers Advisors LLC.

Investment Philosophy  What is Value Investing?   ""An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative."" -Benjamin Graham, ""The Intelligent Investor""  The ""value investing"" model, developed by Benjamin Graham in his texts, Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor, is highly dependent on price. Security selection is therefore a process of identifying situations where companies trade at a significant discount to their liquidation or long-term going-concern value. This discount, defined as the ""margin of safety,"" is critical in two respects. A large margin of safety component not only reduces the risk of a permanent loss of capital but also serves as the platform for significant future gain. Superior returns on investment often result when the marketplace ultimately recognizes the true value of the enterprise.  Value investing incorporates principles that have produced extraordinary returns for money managers through several market cycles over many decades. Kahn Brothers has the experience required to successfully apply these principles to the selection of securities. We do not attempt to time broad directional swings in market levels, interest rates or exchange rates. We are not interested in annual benchmark comparisons. A study of the performance of successful value-oriented investment managers over long periods of time found they under-performed market indices 30% - 40% of the time. In other words, out-performing an index 60% - 70% of the time produced highly satisfactory risk-adjusted rates of returns for these successful managers. Furthermore, investors appreciate that value investing generates tax efficient returns resulting from both long holding periods and favorable tax rates.  Kahn Brothers employs a bottom-up stock selection approach, and invests in undervalued equity securities that are usually out-of-favor in the market. We select securities, one at a time, based on asset valuations, operating performance metrics and long-term fundamental business prospects. Unlike many investment managers, we spend a considerable amount of effort evaluating the downside risk of every investment.  If there are very few values to be found in a given period, we are comfortable holding cash, rather than placing money in speculative, overpriced issues. We will not invest in an overpriced market simply to become fully invested but will patiently wait for attractive situations to present themselves.   Kahn Brothers thinks of a portfolio as an orchard of fruit trees. One cannot expect fruit every year from each species of tree. Investments can and often do have varied and unpredictable timetables to maturity. We believe a suitable time horizon for investment fruit to ripen for harvest can be three to five years or longer. Indeed, a key factor in realizing outstanding performance is having the discipline and patience to maintain time-tested principles and not abandon the orchard before the fruit has ripened.  Kahn Brothers views the investment process as a combination of art and science. Each investment decision has both quantitative and qualitative aspects. While a novice can readily duplicate the former, the latter can only be acquired after decades of analyzing investment opportunities. A key element to outstanding investment performance is bringing these two factors together.  Value investing incorporates only one methodology for securities selection. While many consider it to entail less risk than some other approaches, it can produce returns below popular indices for multiple annual intervals. Value investing may result in concentrated portfolios and will not produce portfolios diversified by investment style. These potential risks must be considered by any investor utilizing the services of Kahn Brothers Advisors LLC.  The following views summarize our methodology for evaluating each specific equity investment:  ""We study companies and try to find undervalued securities... We're absolute value investors focusing on asset values, book value discounts and low price to earnings ratios to normalized earnings. And we aren't interested in so-called relative values -- you know, something selling at 20 times earnings in an industry group with a 35 multiple."" -Thomas Graham Kahn, ""Outstanding Investor Digest""  I. Broad Investment Criteria  INDUSTRY - We invest in industries and businesses that we understand, focusing on depressed economic sectors, rather than the popular industries of the day. Significant capital gains can be achieved through investment in well-established industries. We therefore prefer seasoned businesses less likely to experience major structural change.  COMPANY SIZE - We often concentrate on small and medium capitalization stocks. Such securities may be traded in the less liquid over-the counter market. These companies frequently have a lesser following among security analysts and institutional investors. Small institutional ownership increases the likelihood of inefficient pricing, which helps create bargain opportunities.  MANAGEMENT - We prefer a company whose management holds a meaningful stake in the growth of the business and will protect their own, as well as the shareholders interests. We are less comfortable with situations in which management has aggressive compensation packages, little financial risk and nominal ownership interest.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE - We search for companies with solid balance sheets, strong working capital positions and minimal leverage. We analyze the balance sheet, not the income statement, first. Consequently, many of our investments have strong financial positions and weak short-term earnings. Companies with depressed earnings are more likely to be under-priced in the market.  II. Typical Investment Metrics  NET WORKING CAPITAL DISCOUNTS are stocks selling below net working capital per share after subtracting all long-term liabilities. In other words, if you subtract all current liabilities from all current assets, then further subtract all long-term liabilities and, finally, divide the remaining figure by the number of shares outstanding, you derive the net working capital per share. If a stock sells for less than this figure, you have an attractive price that always warrants a thorough investigation.  BOOK VALUE DISCOUNTS are securities that sell for less than the adjusted per share book value (stated net worth) on their balance sheet. Book value per share is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets and then dividing the remaining balance by the number of outstanding shares. Intangible assets are typically excluded from our definition of book value, and assets and liabilities often require some fair market value adjustments.  LOW P/E RATIO STOCKS are securities that sell at low price to normalized earnings multiples or price to normalized cash flow. They may sell at high multiples of current earnings or cash flow.

Investment Philosophy  The investment management principles practiced by Tweedy, Browne derive from the work of the late Benjamin Graham, professor of investments at Columbia Business School and author of Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor. Tweedy, Browne’s research seeks to appraise the worth of a company, what Graham called “intrinsic value,” by determining its acquisition value, or by estimating the collateral value of its assets and/or cash flow. The term “intrinsic value” may also be referred to as private market value, breakup value or liquidation value. The process is more closely related to credit analysis, for as we have said, we are as concerned with the return of our capital as we are with the return on our capital. Investments are made at a significant discount to intrinsic value, which Graham called an investor’s “margin of safety.” Investments are generally sold as the market price approaches intrinsic value, with the proceeds reinvested in other situations offering a greater discount to intrinsic value. Adhering to the principles of intrinsic value and margin of safety results in an investment policy that runs counter to the general market psychology, and seeks to reduce the decision to purchase or sell securities to a discipline rather than an art.  In determining intrinsic value, our research focuses on fundamental principles of balance sheet and income statement analysis, and a knowledge and understanding of actual corporate mergers, acquisitions, and liquidations. From more than 20,000 publicly traded corporations worldwide, we research and select for investment, those issues selling at substantial discounts to our estimate of intrinsic value. To minimize errors in analysis or events which could adversely affect intrinsic values, we adhere to a policy of broad diversification within individual portfolios, with no one issue generally accounting for more than 3% to 5% at cost of portfolio assets, and no one industry group generally accounting for more than 15% to 20% of portfolio value. Portfolios are not constrained by market capitalization considerations with the result that a significant portion of portfolio assets may be invested in smaller (generally under $1 billion) and medium (up to $5 billion) capitalization companies.  Most investments in Tweedy, Browne portfolios have one or more of the following investment characteristics: low stock price in relation to book value, low price-to-earnings ratio, low price-to-cash-flow ratio, above-average dividend yield, low price-to-sales ratio as compared to other companies in the same industry, low corporate leverage, low share price, purchases of a company’s own stock by the company’s officers and directors, company share repurchases, a stock price that has declined significantly from its previous high price and/or small market capitalization. Academic research and studies have indicated a historical statistical correlation between each of these investment characteristics and above-average investment rates of return over long measurement periods.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=TWEBX

Investment Philosophy  The investment management principles practiced by Tweedy, Browne derive from the work of the late Benjamin Graham, professor of investments at Columbia Business School and author of Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor. Tweedy, Browne’s research seeks to appraise the worth of a company, what Graham called “intrinsic value,” by determining its acquisition value, or by estimating the collateral value of its assets and/or cash flow. The term “intrinsic value” may also be referred to as private market value, breakup value or liquidation value. The process is more closely related to credit analysis, for as we have said, we are as concerned with the return of our capital as we are with the return on our capital. Investments are made at a significant discount to intrinsic value, which Graham called an investor’s “margin of safety.” Investments are generally sold as the market price approaches intrinsic value, with the proceeds reinvested in other situations offering a greater discount to intrinsic value. Adhering to the principles of intrinsic value and margin of safety results in an investment policy that runs counter to the general market psychology, and seeks to reduce the decision to purchase or sell securities to a discipline rather than an art.  In determining intrinsic value, our research focuses on fundamental principles of balance sheet and income statement analysis, and a knowledge and understanding of actual corporate mergers, acquisitions, and liquidations.

Investment Philosophy  The investment management principles practiced by Tweedy, Browne derive from the work of the late Benjamin Graham, professor of investments at Columbia Business School and author of Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor. Tweedy, Browne’s research seeks to appraise the worth of a company, what Graham called “intrinsic value,” by determining its acquisition value, or by estimating the collateral value of its assets and/or cash flow. The term “intrinsic value” may also be referred to as private market value, breakup value or liquidation value. The process is more closely related to credit analysis, for as we have said, we are as concerned with the return of our capital as we are with the return on our capital. Investments are made at a significant discount to intrinsic value, which Graham called an investor’s “margin of safety.” Investments are generally sold as the market price approaches intrinsic value, with the proceeds reinvested in other situations offering a greater discount to intrinsic value. Adhering to the principles of intrinsic value and margin of safety results in an investment policy that runs counter to the general market psychology, and seeks to reduce the decision to purchase or sell securities to a discipline rather than an art.  In determining intrinsic value, our research focuses on fundamental principles of balance sheet and income statement analysis, and a knowledge and understanding of actual corporate mergers, acquisitions, and liquidations. From more than 20,000 publicly traded corporations worldwide, we research and select for investment, those issues selling at substantial discounts to our estimate of intrinsic value. To minimize errors in analysis or events which could adversely affect intrinsic values, we adhere to a policy of broad diversification within individual portfolios, with no one issue generally accounting for more than 3% to 5% at cost of portfolio assets, and no one industry group generally accounting for more than 15% to 20% of portfolio value.

Investment Philosophy  The investment management principles practiced by Tweedy, Browne derive from the work of the late Benjamin Graham, professor of investments at Columbia Business School and author of Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor. Tweedy, Browne’s research seeks to appraise the worth of a company, what Graham called “intrinsic value,” by determining its acquisition value, or by estimating the collateral value of its assets and/or cash flow. The term “intrinsic value” may also be referred to as private market value, breakup value or liquidation value. The process is more closely related to credit analysis, for as we have said, we are as concerned with the return of our capital as we are with the return on our capital. Investments are made at a significant discount to intrinsic value, which Graham called an investor’s “margin of safety.” Investments are generally sold as the market price approaches intrinsic value, with the proceeds reinvested in other situations offering a greater discount to intrinsic value. Adhering to the principles of intrinsic value and margin of safety results in an investment policy that runs counter to the general market psychology, and seeks to reduce the decision to purchase or sell securities to a discipline rather than an art.  In determining intrinsic value, our research focuses on fundamental principles of balance sheet and income statement analysis, and a knowledge and understanding of actual corporate mergers, acquisitions, and liquidations. From more than 20,000 publicly traded corporations worldwide, we research and select for investment, those issues selling at substantial discounts to our estimate of intrinsic value. To minimize errors in analysis or events which could adversely affect intrinsic values, we adhere to a policy of broad diversification within individual portfolios, with no one issue generally accounting for more than 3% to 5% at cost of portfolio assets, and no one industry group generally accounting for more than 15% to 20% of portfolio value. Portfolios are not constrained by market capitalization considerations with the result that a significant portion of portfolio assets may be invested in smaller (generally under $1 billion) and medium (up to $5 billion) capitalization companies.  Most investments in Tweedy, Browne portfolios have one or more of the following investment characteristics: low stock price in relation to book value, low price-to-earnings ratio, low price-to-cash-flow ratio, above-average dividend yield, low price-to-sales ratio as compared to other companies in the same industry, low corporate leverage, low share price, purchases of a company’s own stock by the company’s officers and directors, company share repurchases, a stock price that has declined significantly from its previous high price and/or small market capitalization. Academic research and studies have indicated a historical statistical correlation between each of these investment characteristics and above-average investment rates of return over long measurement periods.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=TWEBX

Investment Philosophy  The investment management principles practiced by Tweedy, Browne derive from the work of the late Benjamin Graham, professor of investments at Columbia Business School and author of Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor. Tweedy, Browne’s research seeks to appraise the worth of a company, what Graham called “intrinsic value,” by determining its acquisition value, or by estimating the collateral value of its assets and/or cash flow. The term “intrinsic value” may also be referred to as private market value, breakup value or liquidation value. The process is more closely related to credit analysis, for as we have said, we are as concerned with the return of our capital as we are with the return on our capital. Investments are made at a significant discount to intrinsic value, which Graham called an investor’s “margin of safety.” Investments are generally sold as the market price approaches intrinsic value, with the proceeds reinvested in other situations offering a greater discount to intrinsic value.

Investment Philosophy  The investment management principles practiced by Tweedy, Browne derive from the work of the late Benjamin Graham, professor of investments at Columbia Business School and author of Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor. Tweedy, Browne’s research seeks to appraise the worth of a company, what Graham called “intrinsic value,” by determining its acquisition value, or by estimating the collateral value of its assets and/or cash flow. The term “intrinsic value” may also be referred to as private market value, breakup value or liquidation value. The process is more closely related to credit analysis, for as we have said, we are as concerned with the return of our capital as we are with the return on our capital. Investments are made at a significant discount to intrinsic value, which Graham called an investor’s “margin of safety.” Investments are generally sold as the market price approaches intrinsic value, with the proceeds reinvested in other situations offering a greater discount to intrinsic value. Adhering to the principles of intrinsic value and margin of safety results in an investment policy that runs counter to the general market psychology, and seeks to reduce the decision to purchase or sell securities to a discipline rather than an art.  In determining intrinsic value, our research focuses on fundamental principles of balance sheet and income statement analysis, and a knowledge and understanding of actual corporate mergers, acquisitions, and liquidations. From more than 20,000 publicly traded corporations worldwide, we research and select for investment, those issues selling at substantial discounts to our estimate of intrinsic value.

Investment Philosophy  The investment management principles practiced by Tweedy, Browne derive from the work of the late Benjamin Graham, professor of investments at Columbia Business School and author of Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor. Tweedy, Browne’s research seeks to appraise the worth of a company, what Graham called “intrinsic value,” by determining its acquisition value, or by estimating the collateral value of its assets and/or cash flow. The term “intrinsic value” may also be referred to as private market value, breakup value or liquidation value. The process is more closely related to credit analysis, for as we have said, we are as concerned with the return of our capital as we are with the return on our capital. Investments are made at a significant discount to intrinsic value, which Graham called an investor’s “margin of safety.” Investments are generally sold as the market price approaches intrinsic value, with the proceeds reinvested in other situations offering a greater discount to intrinsic value. Adhering to the principles of intrinsic value and margin of safety results in an investment policy that runs counter to the general market psychology, and seeks to reduce the decision to purchase or sell securities to a discipline rather than an art.  In determining intrinsic value, our research focuses on fundamental principles of balance sheet and income statement analysis, and a knowledge and understanding of actual corporate mergers, acquisitions, and liquidations. From more than 20,000 publicly traded corporations worldwide, we research and select for investment, those issues selling at substantial discounts to our estimate of intrinsic value. To minimize errors in analysis or events which could adversely affect intrinsic values, we adhere to a policy of broad diversification within individual portfolios, with no one issue generally accounting for more than 3% to 5% at cost of portfolio assets, and no one industry group generally accounting for more than 15% to 20% of portfolio value. Portfolios are not constrained by market capitalization considerations with the result that a significant portion of portfolio assets may be invested in smaller (generally under $1 billion) and medium (up to $5 billion) capitalization companies.  Most investments in Tweedy, Browne portfolios have one or more of the following investment characteristics: low stock price in relation to book value, low price-to-earnings ratio, low price-to-cash-flow ratio, above-average dividend yield, low price-to-sales ratio as compared to other companies in the same industry, low corporate leverage, low share price, purchases of a company’s own stock by the company’s officers and directors, company share repurchases, a stock price that has declined significantly from its previous high price and/or small market capitalization.

Strategy & Discipline  We have one primary objective: To earn superior investment returns on our clients', and our own, capital without taking unnecessary risks.  Our strategy is to try to understand what a rational buyer would be willing to pay for 100% of a given company. Our valuation may focus on asset values, earning power, the intangible value of a company's ""franchise"" in its market, or a combination of these variables. We then try to buy shares of the company's stock at a significant discount to this ""private market value"". It is this discount that provides the ""margin of safety"" that minimizes the risk of permanent loss of capital.  While the relationship between price and intrinsic value is the central focus of ""value investing"" as taught by Benjamin Graham, we are also very attentive to certain qualitative factors. We seek companies with the following characteristics:  A business we can understand. A business having some control over its own destiny by virtue of a niche or franchise that insulates it from competition and allows it to price its products adequately. A business that generates more cash than it needs to conduct its operations. A business having honest, intelligent management who treat shareholders as partners in the business, rather than necessary evils. If a business satisfies these criteria, AND its stock is available at a very attractive price, we are interested.  The beauty of this approach is that it depends on common sense and patience rather than special sources of information or predictions of (essentially unpredictable) future events. Applied intelligently, it reduces the chances of permanent loss of capital, and can produce good long-term returns.  Lest this process sound too simple, it is important to remember that investing is still more art than science, and we have very little control over short-term investment results. Emotions tend to determine stock prices in the short run, and our job is to take advantage of the irrational price changes that occur. Short-term declines can be great opportunities to invest capital, and periods of euphoria sometimes allow us to earn our returns sooner than expected.  We will sometimes seem to be out of sync with the Market, but the key is to be disciplined about the application of our investment criteria. When we have trouble finding stocks to buy at reasonable prices, we may hold significant cash reserves. The price of this discipline is sometimes missed opportunity, and we accept that.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=WVALX

Strategy & Discipline  We have one primary objective: To earn superior investment returns on our clients', and our own, capital without taking unnecessary risks.  Our strategy is to try to understand what a rational buyer would be willing to pay for 100% of a given company. Our valuation may focus on asset values, earning power, the intangible value of a company's ""franchise"" in its market, or a combination of these variables. We then try to buy shares of the company's stock at a significant discount to this ""private market value"". It is this discount that provides the ""margin of safety"" that minimizes the risk of permanent loss of capital.  While the relationship between price and intrinsic value is the central focus of ""value investing"" as taught by Benjamin Graham, we are also very attentive to certain qualitative factors. We seek companies with the following characteristics:  A business we can understand. A business having some control over its own destiny by virtue of a niche or franchise that insulates it from competition and allows it to price its products adequately. A business that generates more cash than it needs to conduct its operations. A business having honest, intelligent management who treat shareholders as partners in the business, rather than necessary evils.

While the relationship between price and intrinsic value is the central focus of ""value investing"" as taught by Benjamin Graham, we are also very attentive to certain qualitative factors. We seek companies with the following characteristics:  A business we can understand. A business having some control over its own destiny by virtue of a niche or franchise that insulates it from competition and allows it to price its products adequately. A business that generates more cash than it needs to conduct its operations. A business having honest, intelligent management who treat shareholders as partners in the business, rather than necessary evils. If a business satisfies these criteria, AND its stock is available at a very attractive price, we are interested.  The beauty of this approach is that it depends on common sense and patience rather than special sources of information or predictions of (essentially unpredictable) future events. Applied intelligently, it reduces the chances of permanent loss of capital, and can produce good long-term returns.  Lest this process sound too simple, it is important to remember that investing is still more art than science, and we have very little control over short-term investment results. Emotions tend to determine stock prices in the short run, and our job is to take advantage of the irrational price changes that occur. Short-term declines can be great opportunities to invest capital, and periods of euphoria sometimes allow us to earn our returns sooner than expected.

Investment Strategy  Since its inception in 1993, the Fund has been managed by Steven Romick, Trustee, President, and Chief Investment Officer.  The Fund actively seeks value in all parts of a company's capital structure, including common and preferred stocks, as well as corporate and convertible bonds. The manager invests in securities ""that the consensus does not wish to own,"" searching for stocks and convertible bonds that reflect low price/earnings ratios (P/Es) and trade at discounts to private market value.  This contrarian style leads to those investments that offer absolute rather than relative value. An absolute value is an investment that trades at a substantial discount to private market value, rather than one that might appear inexpensive based on a discount to its peer group or the market average. Attention is directed toward those companies offering the best combination of such quality criteria as strong market share, good management, and high normalized return on capital. A company purchased might not look inexpensive, considering current earnings and return on capital; however, its valuation may reflect such conditions as a weak economy, an increase in raw material costs, a management misstep, or any number of other temporary conditions. The price drops caused by such developments can and often do provide buying opportunities.   The manager's intensive research identifies these opportunities. The process includes looking for ideas by reviewing stock price or industry group underperformance, insider purchases, management changes, and corporate spin-offs. Researching a prospective investment involves communicating directly with company management, suppliers, and customers, better defining future potential, financial strength, and the company's competitive position. Fundamental analysis provides a thorough view of financial and business characteristics, allowing for the determination of absolute value. The manager's confidence in this research must be high enough to allow him to purchase and hold such companies for an average of one to three years.   The manager applies this contrarian style in the belief that the path to superior equity returns lies in ""buying what others are selling and selling what others are buying.""

This contrarian style leads to those investments that offer absolute rather than relative value. An absolute value is an investment that trades at a substantial discount to private market value, rather than one that might appear inexpensive based on a discount to its peer group or the market average. Attention is directed toward those companies offering the best combination of such quality criteria as strong market share, good management, and high normalized return on capital. A company purchased might not look inexpensive, considering current earnings and return on capital; however, its valuation may reflect such conditions as a weak economy, an increase in raw material costs, a management misstep, or any number of other temporary conditions. The price drops caused by such developments can and often do provide buying opportunities.   The manager's intensive research identifies these opportunities. The process includes looking for ideas by reviewing stock price or industry group underperformance, insider purchases, management changes, and corporate spin-offs. Researching a prospective investment involves communicating directly with company management, suppliers, and customers, better defining future potential, financial strength, and the company's competitive position. Fundamental analysis provides a thorough view of financial and business characteristics, allowing for the determination of absolute value. The manager's confidence in this research must be high enough to allow him to purchase and hold such companies for an average of one to three years.

A company purchased might not look inexpensive, considering current earnings and return on capital; however, its valuation may reflect such conditions as a weak economy, an increase in raw material costs, a management misstep, or any number of other temporary conditions. The price drops caused by such developments can and often do provide buying opportunities.   The manager's intensive research identifies these opportunities. The process includes looking for ideas by reviewing stock price or industry group underperformance, insider purchases, management changes, and corporate spin-offs. Researching a prospective investment involves communicating directly with company management, suppliers, and customers, better defining future potential, financial strength, and the company's competitive position. Fundamental analysis provides a thorough view of financial and business characteristics, allowing for the determination of absolute value. The manager's confidence in this research must be high enough to allow him to purchase and hold such companies for an average of one to three years.

The process includes looking for ideas by reviewing stock price or industry group underperformance, insider purchases, management changes, and corporate spin-offs. Researching a prospective investment involves communicating directly with company management, suppliers, and customers, better defining future potential, financial strength, and the company's competitive position. Fundamental analysis provides a thorough view of financial and business characteristics, allowing for the determination of absolute value. The manager's confidence in this research must be high enough to allow him to purchase and hold such companies for an average of one to three years.   The manager applies this contrarian style in the belief that the path to superior equity returns lies in ""buying what others are selling and selling what others are buying.""

Investment Strategy  Since its inception in 1993, the Fund has been managed by Steven Romick, Trustee, President, and Chief Investment Officer.  The Fund actively seeks value in all parts of a company's capital structure, including common and preferred stocks, as well as corporate and convertible bonds. The manager invests in securities ""that the consensus does not wish to own,"" searching for stocks and convertible bonds that reflect low price/earnings ratios (P/Es) and trade at discounts to private market value.  This contrarian style leads to those investments that offer absolute rather than relative value. An absolute value is an investment that trades at a substantial discount to private market value, rather than one that might appear inexpensive based on a discount to its peer group or the market average. Attention is directed toward those companies offering the best combination of such quality criteria as strong market share, good management, and high normalized return on capital.

OBJECTIVES The Fund seeks long-term growth of principal and income. A secondary objective is to achieve a reasonable current income.  STRATEGY The Fund invests primarily in a broadly diversified portfolio of common stocks. In selecting investments, the Fund invests in companies that, in Dodge & Cox’s opinion, appear to be temporarily undervalued by the stock market but have a favorable outlook for long-term growth. The Fund focuses on the underlying financial condition and prospects of individual companies, including future earnings, cash flow and dividends. Various other factors, including financial strength, economic condition, competitive advantage, quality of the business franchise and the reputation, experience and competence of a company's management are weighed against valuation in selecting individual securities.  Long-Term Approach Decades of investing have taught us that the perception of an investment’s worth fluctuates much more widely than its underlying fundamentals. We are skeptical that short-term market trends can be predicted with consistency, so we look further out in our analysis, focusing on the key fundamental factors that will determine investment value over the long-term. As our view diverges from the consensus, we find investment opportunities. We continually focus on the long-term by asking ourselves the hypothetical question: based on what we know now, how would we invest an “all-cash” portfolio today assuming we could not trade for the next three to five years? This framework forces us to reevaluate our portfolio holdings within an ever-changing market environment, and to reaffirm our rationale for each investment’s long-term value.  Strict Price Discipline From the earliest days, Dodge & Cox’s investment approach has stressed evaluation of risk relative to opportunity. A strict price discipline — steering clear of popular choices that come at a price premium we would rather not pay — is critical to achieving our investment objectives. Low valuation investments, for example, typically reflect low investor expectations that may serve as a buffer against the risk of significant price decline; these low expectations may also create greater potential for capital appreciation should investor pessimism turn out to be unwarranted or short-lived. At all times, our ongoing search for superior relative value is guided by a rigorous research process that seeks to differentiate the short-term concerns that may be temporarily depressing an investment from the intractable, long-term problems that could doom it.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=DODGX

STRATEGY The Fund invests primarily in a broadly diversified portfolio of common stocks. In selecting investments, the Fund invests in companies that, in Dodge & Cox’s opinion, appear to be temporarily undervalued by the stock market but have a favorable outlook for long-term growth. The Fund focuses on the underlying financial condition and prospects of individual companies, including future earnings, cash flow and dividends. Various other factors, including financial strength, economic condition, competitive advantage, quality of the business franchise and the reputation, experience and competence of a company's management are weighed against valuation in selecting individual securities.  Long-Term Approach Decades of investing have taught us that the perception of an investment’s worth fluctuates much more widely than its underlying fundamentals. We are skeptical that short-term market trends can be predicted with consistency, so we look further out in our analysis, focusing on the key fundamental factors that will determine investment value over the long-term. As our view diverges from the consensus, we find investment opportunities. We continually focus on the long-term by asking ourselves the hypothetical question: based on what we know now, how would we invest an “all-cash” portfolio today assuming we could not trade for the next three to five years? This framework forces us to reevaluate our portfolio holdings within an ever-changing market environment, and to reaffirm our rationale for each investment’s long-term value.  Strict Price Discipline From the earliest days, Dodge & Cox’s investment approach has stressed evaluation of risk relative to opportunity. A strict price discipline — steering clear of popular choices that come at a price premium we would rather not pay — is critical to achieving our investment objectives. Low valuation investments, for example, typically reflect low investor expectations that may serve as a buffer against the risk of significant price decline; these low expectations may also create greater potential for capital appreciation should investor pessimism turn out to be unwarranted or short-lived. At all times, our ongoing search for superior relative value is guided by a rigorous research process that seeks to differentiate the short-term concerns that may be temporarily depressing an investment from the intractable, long-term problems that could doom it.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=DODGX

OBJECTIVES The Fund seeks long-term growth of principal and income. A secondary objective is to achieve a reasonable current income.  STRATEGY The Fund invests primarily in a broadly diversified portfolio of common stocks. In selecting investments, the Fund invests in companies that, in Dodge & Cox’s opinion, appear to be temporarily undervalued by the stock market but have a favorable outlook for long-term growth. The Fund focuses on the underlying financial condition and prospects of individual companies, including future earnings, cash flow and dividends. Various other factors, including financial strength, economic condition, competitive advantage, quality of the business franchise and the reputation, experience and competence of a company's management are weighed against valuation in selecting individual securities.  Long-Term Approach Decades of investing have taught us that the perception of an investment’s worth fluctuates much more widely than its underlying fundamentals. We are skeptical that short-term market trends can be predicted with consistency, so we look further out in our analysis, focusing on the key fundamental factors that will determine investment value over the long-term. As our view diverges from the consensus, we find investment opportunities. We continually focus on the long-term by asking ourselves the hypothetical question: based on what we know now, how would we invest an “all-cash” portfolio today assuming we could not trade for the next three to five years? This framework forces us to reevaluate our portfolio holdings within an ever-changing market environment, and to reaffirm our rationale for each investment’s long-term value.

In selecting investments, the Fund invests in companies that, in Dodge & Cox’s opinion, appear to be temporarily undervalued by the stock market but have a favorable outlook for long-term growth. The Fund focuses on the underlying financial condition and prospects of individual companies, including future earnings, cash flow and dividends. Various other factors, including financial strength, economic condition, competitive advantage, quality of the business franchise and the reputation, experience and competence of a company's management are weighed against valuation in selecting individual securities.  Long-Term Approach Decades of investing have taught us that the perception of an investment’s worth fluctuates much more widely than its underlying fundamentals. We are skeptical that short-term market trends can be predicted with consistency, so we look further out in our analysis, focusing on the key fundamental factors that will determine investment value over the long-term. As our view diverges from the consensus, we find investment opportunities. We continually focus on the long-term by asking ourselves the hypothetical question: based on what we know now, how would we invest an “all-cash” portfolio today assuming we could not trade for the next three to five years? This framework forces us to reevaluate our portfolio holdings within an ever-changing market environment, and to reaffirm our rationale for each investment’s long-term value.  Strict Price Discipline From the earliest days, Dodge & Cox’s investment approach has stressed evaluation of risk relative to opportunity. A strict price discipline — steering clear of popular choices that come at a price premium we would rather not pay — is critical to achieving our investment objectives. Low valuation investments, for example, typically reflect low investor expectations that may serve as a buffer against the risk of significant price decline; these low expectations may also create greater potential for capital appreciation should investor pessimism turn out to be unwarranted or short-lived. At all times, our ongoing search for superior relative value is guided by a rigorous research process that seeks to differentiate the short-term concerns that may be temporarily depressing an investment from the intractable, long-term problems that could doom it.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=DODGX

This framework forces us to reevaluate our portfolio holdings within an ever-changing market environment, and to reaffirm our rationale for each investment’s long-term value.  Strict Price Discipline From the earliest days, Dodge & Cox’s investment approach has stressed evaluation of risk relative to opportunity. A strict price discipline — steering clear of popular choices that come at a price premium we would rather not pay — is critical to achieving our investment objectives. Low valuation investments, for example, typically reflect low investor expectations that may serve as a buffer against the risk of significant price decline; these low expectations may also create greater potential for capital appreciation should investor pessimism turn out to be unwarranted or short-lived. At all times, our ongoing search for superior relative value is guided by a rigorous research process that seeks to differentiate the short-term concerns that may be temporarily depressing an investment from the intractable, long-term problems that could doom it.",31 Dec 2021,https://www.dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=DODGX

OBJECTIVES The Fund seeks long-term growth of principal and income. A secondary objective is to achieve a reasonable current income.  STRATEGY The Fund invests primarily in a broadly diversified portfolio of common stocks. In selecting investments, the Fund invests in companies that, in Dodge & Cox’s opinion, appear to be temporarily undervalued by the stock market but have a favorable outlook for long-term growth. The Fund focuses on the underlying financial condition and prospects of individual companies, including future earnings, cash flow and dividends. Various other factors, including financial strength, economic condition, competitive advantage, quality of the business franchise and the reputation, experience and competence of a company's management are weighed against valuation in selecting individual securities.  Long-Term Approach Decades of investing have taught us that the perception of an investment’s worth fluctuates much more widely than its underlying fundamentals. We are skeptical that short-term market trends can be predicted with consistency, so we look further out in our analysis, focusing on the key fundamental factors that will determine investment value over the long-term.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND APPROACH Ariel Appreciation Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in common stocks of companies with market capitalizations between $2.5 billion and $15 billion measured at the time of purchase. The Fund invests in undervalued companies that show strong potential for growth. To capture anticipated growth, the Fund holds investments for a relatively long period of time – generally five years.  Our Approach to Investing  Our investment philosophy depends upon three interrelated tenets:  patience, focus, and independent thinking, which drive our contrarian approach.  Our divergence from conventional wisdom allows us to add value by taking advantage of the market’s few and small pockets of inefficiency.  A Patient View  “Time is the friend of the wonderful company, the enemy of the mediocre.” — Warren Buffett   Compels us to wait for the perfect pitch—differentiated companies with strong cash flows, low debt, high quality products or services, significant barriers to entry and low reinvestment requirements. Permits us to use the market’s short-term thinking to our advantage since our longer term approach allows us to be opportunistic as price dislocations arise. Enables us to take our time to research a name and wait as long as necessary for it to possess the margin of safety we require. Leads us to build extensive third party networks that inform our stock picking.   A Focused Approach  “Invest within your circle of competence.” — Warren Buffett   Allows us to build expertise and accumulate deep knowledge. Augments our conviction, especially during crunch time when it matters most. Enables us to learn from our mistakes and make fewer of them. Leads us to isolate the key issues of importance to a company in the midst of the market noise. Results in our portfolio concentration in a limited number of names and a limited number of industries. Allows us to build and cultivate our third–party sources more effectively. We don’t own a little bit of everything because we can’t know everything—we choose to go deep instead of broad.   A Team of Independent Thinkers  “If you buy the same stocks as everyone else, you get the same results.” — Sir John Templeton   Encourages us to buy out of favor, misunderstood and ignored stocks. Compels us to buy when others are selling and to sell when others are buying. Leads us to perform our own original, proprietary research.

A Focused Approach  “Invest within your circle of competence.” — Warren Buffett   Allows us to build expertise and accumulate deep knowledge.

Leads us to isolate the key issues of importance to a company in the midst of the market noise. Results in our portfolio concentration in a limited number of names and a limited number of industries.

NVESTMENT STRATEGY AND APPROACH Ariel Focus Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing primarily in common stocks of companies with market capitalizations in excess of $10 billion measured at the time of purchase. The Fund invests in undervalued companies that show strong potential for growth. To capture anticipated growth, the Fund holds investments for a relatively long period of time – generally five years.
